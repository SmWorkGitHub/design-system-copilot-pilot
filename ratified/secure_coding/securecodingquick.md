# Secure Coding Guidelines Checklist

This is a quick reference guide for the content in the [Secure Coding Standards and Review Guidelines](secure_coding_and_reviews.md) document. The intent of the checklist is so development teams or code reviewers can track and capture implementation status of these practices.

This checklist is not meant to be a replacement for a code review (manual or automated). Code review as part of the Pull Request process should be used together with architecture threat analysis, penetration testing, and automated tools.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Secure Coding Best Practice | Implementation Status (Yes, No, N/A, Partial) | Comments |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------: | :------: |
| __Authentication__ | | |
| Use of multi-factor authentication | | |
| Standard authentication mechanism such as IAM in use | | |
| Enforce strong password requirements [See Global Security Policy â€“ Passwords for more information.](https://hpe.sharepoint.com/sites/WW/globalsecurity/Pages/global-security-policy.aspx?ID=2897) | | |
| Remember me functionality is disabled | | |
| CSRF handlers/tokens in use | | |
| No use of default passwords | | |
| No use of shared credentials | | |
| Use of basic authentication requires encrypted connection: *preferred approach is utilizing token based authn* | | |
| Secure API Design (i.e. Strong authentication, valid token, size and rate limiting) | | |
| __Secret/Sensitive Data Management__ | | |
| Sensitive information is not stored in source code: *credentials, keys, tokens, PII, etc.* | | |
| Protect sensitive credentials such as private keys using key vaults or other means | | |
| Credentials are protected with encryption and access control mechanisms | | |
| Database credentials are not hard coded in source code | | |
| No sensitive information is logged: *SSNs, PII, credentials, keys, tokens, etc.* | | |
| Stored sensitive data is encrypted | | |
| No sensitive or critical information is stored in cookies | | |
| __Authorization and Principle of Least Privilege__ | | |
| Authorization checks are efficient and applied consistently | | |
| Every entry point and function should be authorized | | |
| Use principle of least privilege | | |
| Use default-deny authorization pattern for security sensitive functionality | | |
| Set file permissions to minimum level required: *do not use 0777* | | |
| __Cryptography and Transport Security__ | | |
| Use trusted CA (either external or internal) to verify that all TLS certificate checks are in place | | |
| Use TLS 1.2 or 1.3 by default with no support for downgrading to lower TLS/SSL versions | | |
| Certificate validation is not disabled | | |
| Use standard hashing algorithms: *use an [HPE approved algorithm](https://hpe.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/msteams_532f51/ESIs8BL56qJPg4p5bu0rBWMBm8mfP3FvEK7YdZjuMAsaZA?e=8j0aKa), no custom cryptography* **No deprecated algorithms, such as MD5, SHA1, etc*. | | |
| Any cryptographic keys creation uses a secure Key Derivation Function and Random Number Generator see [HPE PSO Secure Design and Coding Guidelines](https://hpe.sharepoint.com/teams/infrastructure-security/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fteams%2Finfrastructure%2Dsecurity%2FShared%20Documents%2FSTAR%5FRepository%2FSDL%2FHPE%20Common%20Secure%20Design%20and%20Coding&FolderCTID=0x012000562BC6522769AF42950D43BD818AE880) | | |
| __Injection Protections__ | | |
| Use parameterized queries when constructing a SQL query from input variables | | |
| All user supplied input is validated: *data should be validated against a list of allowed values* | | |
| All user supplied data that is displayed back uses output encoding | | |
| Use absolute and canonical paths where possible | | |
| If user input must be used in file system calls, proper validation and sanitization must be followed | | |
| Avoid feeding user input directly in commands (such as Eval(), Exec(), OS commands, etc.) | | |
| __Session and Cookie Management__ | | |
| Session ID name is not extremely descriptive and does not contain PII | | |
| Session tokens contain 128 bits of randomness generated by a cryptographically sound random number generator | | |
| Session timeout after inactivity (15-30 minutes) | | |
| Session have maximum life (< 8 hours) | | |
| Session IDs are not exposed in URLs and are only transmitted over TLS | | |
| Set expiration dates on cookies to the shortest practical time | | |
| Avoid using permanent cookies | | |
| Consider setting the Secure and HttpOnly properties on the cookie to true | | |
| Cookies do not store critical information | | |
| Ensure tokens are generated and signed using strong algorithms | | |
| Protect tokens like any other secret in a trusted store configured with least privilege | | |
| Ensure you use secure vaults for storing application specific secrets | | |
| __Logging/Exceptions__ | | |
| Log all security relevant actions | | |
| When logging user input, use proper input validation | | |
| Ensure Error messages are not verbose: *do not contain too much information* | | |
| __Secure Coding Design and Process__ | | |
| Implementation uses a [memory-safe language](secure_coding_and_reviews.md#requirements-for-implementation-language) | | |
| Scan source code using a SAST tool such as gosec or HPE/GLCP Approved tools prior to build/release | | |
| Verify SAST output and complete any necessary code fixes including peer review of critical code/fixes | | |
| For Go, utilize pprof for identifying memory leaks | | |
| Design to fail gracefully | | |
| Remove old/unused code | | |
| Remove unused dependencies | | |
| Track and update dependencies through an automated method such as Dependabot | | |
| Maintain an accurate list of OSS and 3rd party software used in your application | | |
| All OSS Software is approved by the HPE Open Source Review Board and all OSS and 3rd party software registered with VTN | | |
| Scan your application using HPE/GLCP approved DAST Scanners for OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities. Ensure all critical/high issues are fixed | | |
| Developers have taken security specific training/read [HPE Secure Coding Guidelines](secure_coding_and_reviews.md) | | |
