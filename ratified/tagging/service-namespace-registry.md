# Registry of Service Namespaces

The following Service Namespaces can be used for service-originated tags as described in [tagging standards](tagging_standard.md)

| Namespace | Description | Owning Application/Service |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
|           |             |                            |

Requests for adding namespaces to the registry should be discussed in the [slack channel](https://hpe-internal.slack.com/archives/C031Z7U5413) and should eventually result in a pull request for this document.
