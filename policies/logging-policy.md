# HPE GreenLake Development Policy for Logging

All cloud services developed within HPE and deployed as part of HPE GreenLake MUST follow the HPE GreenLake [Logging Standard](../ratified/logging/index.md) and the [Cloud Services Logging Standard](../ratified/logging/services.md).

This policy applies in addition to, and does not replace, any other relevant policies applicable to developers at HPE.

## Why Does This Policy Matter?

Standardization of logging enables a consistent approach when training developers and others how to resolve issues in services. This in turn supports transferability of developers between teams and allows someone unfamiliar with a service to diagnose an issue. By improving our ability to interpret logs, service availability and reliability can be increased as issues can be identified and resolved more effectively.

## What Tools and Practices Can Help a Developer or Development Team Comply With This Policy?

Methods to help developers comply with this policy vary across HPE.
