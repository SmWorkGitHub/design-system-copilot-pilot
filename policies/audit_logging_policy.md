# HPE GreenLake Development Policy for Audit Logging

All HPE-authored code MUST create audit log entries for security relevant events.

The [HPE GreenLake Audit Logging Standard](../ratified/logging/audit_logging_guidelines.md) provides a definition of an audit log, including the types of events that need to be audited. It also defines the events and attributes that MUST be included in audit logs (e.g., timestamp, user ID).

The contents of the audit log are used for the following purposes:

* To identify potential security breaches
* To assert which human being authorized changes to be made to a system, by tracking privileged operations that a user performed
* To demonstrate compliance with industry regulations
* To record activity for determining a customerâ€™s obligations

This policy applies in addition to, and does not replace, any other relevant policies applicable to developers at HPE.

## Why Does This Policy Matter?

Adherence to the audit logging policy is required for meeting regulatory requirements (e.g., SOC 2) and for helping to detect and mitigate cybersecurity attacks.
