# HPE GreenLake Development Policy for Definition of Ready

The Hybrid Cloud and OCTO business units of HPE have agreed they MUST and all others have agreed they SHOULD follow the guidance in [Business Feature Definition of
Ready Baseline](../ratified/definition-of-ready-spec.md). The intent is to establish a shared understanding of the necessary conditions that must be fulfilled for a business feature to be considered sufficiently detailed and understood by the delivery team, such that it is actionable / can be committed for delivery into a release increment.

This policy applies in addition to, and does not replace, any other relevant policies applicable to developers at HPE.

## Why Does This Policy Matter?

The expected benefits of this standard include:

* Avoids beginning work that does not have clearly defined completion criteria, thus removing vacillation and/or rework, ultimately contributing to improved business productivity, execution efficiency, and value delivery.
* Ensures a shared understanding of the value to be delivered, high-level cross-functional tasks, dependencies, and promotes team and organizational alignment. The shared understanding will lead to more holistic, inclusive, and improved estimates which will lead to better (feature release, capacity) planning, predictability, and quality.
* Assists in identifying potential issues or risks early, giving teams more time to plan and manage them effectively.
* Provides a mechanism for the delivery team to request further clarification of the requirements before finalizing forecasts based on estimations.
