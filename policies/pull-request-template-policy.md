# HPE GreenLake Development Policy for Pull Request Templates

All merge requests for repositories containing code (such as GitHub pull requests) must include a pull request template to be filled in by the developer at the time of opening the request.

The pull request template created by the organization for developers should include at a minimum the following sections:

* Description or summary of code change
* Context or reason for the code change
* Description or details of the tests conducted:
  * Provide a link to the test harness that was executed
  * Summarize results of contract testing
  * Summarize results of UT or FT testing

This policy applies in addition to, and does not replace, any other relevant policies applicable to developers at HPE.

## Why Does This Policy Matter?

Pull requests are expensive operations that require human review of changes. A pull request template works to focus the developer by summarizing code changes in a descriptive way and helps reviewers understand the context and intent of the code change. A well-formed pull request template can speed code review, improving team delivery velocity.
