# HPE GreenLake Development Policy for Definition of Done

All business units of HPE have agreed they MUST follow the guidance in [Business Feature Definition of
Done Baseline](../ratified/definition-of-done-spec.md). The intent is to establish a shared understanding of what must be done for a feature to be
considered complete and releasable to customers.

This policy applies in addition to, and does not replace, any other relevant policies applicable to developers at HPE.

## Why Does This Policy Matter?

Internal teams from different businesses within HPE have different definitions of the activities required to
establish a featureâ€™s releasability. This leads to inconsistencies in quality at the integrated solution level
resulting in delay and inability to deliver value across the platform.

The Definition of Done is one of the most important practices that ensures release quality by allowing the teams
to align around what quality is and how it is built into the solution. It provides everyone with a shared
understanding of what work is required to be completed and what standards were met as part of value delivery.

This will improve the overall customer experience through bringing levels of consistency in security, quality,
documentation, and usability that our customers can rely on. It will increase organizational efficiency and
incremental delivery, driving greater revenue and lowering risk.
