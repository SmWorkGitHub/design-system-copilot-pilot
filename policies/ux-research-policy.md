# HPE GreenLake Development Policy for UX Research

Conducting UX research is beneficial for ensuring data-driven business decisions. Please contact the UX Research team to identify if, how, and when to do research and anytime you have questions.

You MUST consult UX Research in the following circumstances:

* HPE employees or customers are being surveyed or interviewed, as these types of inquiries require additional review processes to ensure legal compliance.
* The problem, technology, questions, and/or next steps are nebulous and difficult to define. Research can help provide clarity and identify opportunities for HPE’s business overall, or the direction of an individual product or service.
* An experience, feature, or product is being developed based on assumptions about HPE’s users instead of unbiased, evidence-based data.
* A new solution or experience is being defined or launched. New workflows should be tested to ensure they are usable for HPE’s customers. This can also help HPE develop a baseline to measure the impact of future iterations.

You SHOULD follow the guidance in this standard - [UX Research for GreenLake Developers](https://hpe.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/hpeuxr/ESPk5UxCcPhCqAykiefRhDABIHtoBpz-umTFknotaYKo3w?e=UWY73j).

## Why Does This Policy Matter?

* HPE GreenLake customers will benefit from features being designed based on unbiased evidence because features will be targeted to their unique needs.
* Data-backed decision making will increase efficiency and reduce contention among HPE teams.
* Testing will ensure new features are suitable and valuable to HPE GreenLake customers before deployment, which will increase customer satisfaction and reduce costs associated with new features.
* Development and maintenance costs are reduced by testing earlier in the product development lifecycle.
* Support tickets will be reduced by ensuring new features are usable before deployment.
* CSAT scores will improve because HPE GreenLake experiences will be tested and validated by customers.
