# HPE GreenLake Development Policy for Secure Development Lifecycle Practices

All HPE GreenLake software development teams MUST adhere to the secure development practices as outlined in the HPE GreenLake [Secure Development Lifecycle Specification](../ratified/security/SSDF.md).

This policy applies in addition to, and does not replace, any other relevant policies applicable to developers at HPE.

## Why Does This Policy Matter?

This policy helps build security into everything we do within HPE GreenLake. This policy also helps address emerging supply chain attacks and ensures compliance to [NIST Secure Software Development Framework (800-218 SP)](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/218/final), which is increasingly mandated by many customers. This policy also helps implement a shift left security methodology during software development.

## What Tools and Practices Can Help a Developer or Development Team Comply With This Policy?

Methods to help developers comply with this policy vary across HPE.

### For All HPE Developers

A pan-HPE role-based security training program and pan-HPE security tools can be used to implement and verify this policy.
